# C-flat

C-flat is a strongly typed programming language inspired by modern languages like Rust, Zig, Go and many other languages. This is a passion project that Iâ€™m developing for fun, without any rush, and with an open mind about its evolution. None of the syntax is set in stoneâ€”it could change at any moment as I explore new ideas and refine the language.

## Why C-flat?

The name *C-flat* comes from music, where Câ™­ is a note one step lower than C. Similarly, this language takes inspiration from C but aims to provide more modern features and flexibility, particularly in memory management.

One of the core ideas behind C-flat is giving developers full control over memory allocation, much like Zig allows for custom allocators. While this isn't implemented yet, itâ€™s a major goal for the futureâ€”after all, everything starts as an idea!

## Features (Work in Progress)
- **Strong static typing** to catch errors early.
- **Modern syntax** inspired by Rust, Zig, and Go.
- **Custom allocators** (planned) to provide fine-grained memory control.
- **Structs and Enums** to support complex data types.
- **For-loops with iterators**, making iteration expressive and powerful.

## Example Code
Here's a small taste of C-flatâ€™s syntax:

```cflat
// Define a struct
type Point struct {
    x: s32,
    y: s32,
}

// Define an enum
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}

// Nested types within a struct
type ArrayList struct {
    type Iterator struct {
        current: s32,
        end: s32,
    }

    fn iterator(&self) Iterator {
        Iterator {
            current: 0,
            end: self.len(),
        }
    }
}

// Entry point
fn main() void {
    const a: ArrayList = ArrayList{};
    const b: ArrayList.Iterator = a.iterator();
    for (i in b) {
        println(i);
    }
}
```

## Whatâ€™s Next?
C-flat is still in its extreme early stages, and I'm figuring things out as I go. Right now, Iâ€™m experimenting with syntax, semantics, and figuring out how best to structure the language. If you're interested, feel free to follow the project!

This is a project driven by curiosity and passion. No deadlines, no expectationsâ€”just the joy of building something new. ðŸš€
